/**
 * Empty Content (view)
 * ====================
 * Have you ever needed to duplicate a template, where the new template would
 * be the same except the new template would just have 1 or more elements
 * removed? That is what this file is for.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE: (template/header-none.php)
 *   theme::use_part('empty', 'content', 'header');
 *   theme::part('index', 'template');
