##Installation

####Requirements

* The ablity to set the directory index
* PHP 5.3 or later (5.7+ for login)

**Note:** The path to LastAutoIndex must absolute from your servers root

####Installing On Apache

Installation is very simple, in your server root `.htaccess`, just disable Apache's default autoindex, and a add LastAutoIndex as a directory index.

**Example:**

```apache
# LastAutoIndex Config
Options -Indexes
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html /path/to/LastAutoIndex/index.php
```

####Other Configurations

As stated in the requirements section, all that is needed is PHP 5.3 + and the ability to set the default directory index. Given you know how to use these in some part of your servers configuration, you shouldn't have problem using LAI. That being said, if you are running on an alternate configuration, you should take a look at [this page](http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/71610/nginx-vs-apache-are-there-any-actual-usage-comparisons-and-statistcs-out-there). (In short, when it comes to server configurations, just use the one your comfortable with)
